# cogdown

Mostly an amalgamated version of [Ned Batchelder's
cog](https://github.com/nedbat/cog) library, with features added to succinctly
render graphviz in markdown.

## Usage

Add input like [example.md](example.md).

Run `python ./cogapp.py -c -r example.md` (`-c` is for checksum, `-r` is for
in-place).
